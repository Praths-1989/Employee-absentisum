# Employee-absentisum using Random Forest algorithum & Some added tablue visualization
The goal of this project is to analyse the given Yato Corp data and check the reasons of absenteeism based on the past data. Absenteeism is an employee's intentional or habitual absence from work. While employers expect workers to miss a certain number of workdays each year, excessive absences can equate to decreased productivity and can have a major effect on company finances, morale and other factors. This project looks at the causes of absenteeism, the costs of lost productivity and what employers can do to reduce absenteeism rates in the workplace.
